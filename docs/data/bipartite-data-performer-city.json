Here is artistry of burlesque done in rare style. Maybe you do not care for this type of broad female impersonations, but these men have real artistry back of all their non-sense. They handed me a terrible comedy wallop. They close their act with a burlesque, the Russian Bat theater. Good costumes and a fine idea is worked out by the three.

It is called an entertainment, but is instead a sad and incomparably stupid demonstrationo f [sic] the fact that nature cannot always call her shots. There are three movies on the program, two short, one long and all bad, and a revue called brazenly 'Boys Will Be Girls.' The billboards scream the statement that its cast is composed of 50 female impersonators, but there are hardly that number, though too many by far. A woman is their shepherd, an obese cutie who begins proceedings by deploring the fact that female impersonaators [sic] are too easily thought of as effeminate, whereas instead they are merely artists exhibiting their art. The madam apologizes further saying that there were illustrious gentlemen of the type in the dramas of the ancient Greeks and in the good Shakespeare's day, indicating that the profession is one of the oldest, if not the most venerable. Chatty and something of a historian, the fat woman goes on the e5/8ect [sic] that once New Jersey and New York had a Governor who governed both States at the same time, dressed as a woman, this, presumably, being proof that her own swarm of ungentlemanly androgynes are not accidents, but artists. Further, to substantiate her belief, she announces that they are all members of a club in Atlantic City, a club called by the name of an otherwise ino5/8emsove little 3/8ower that long since bowed its head in shame. The little name is exposed with hopeful prominence on the billboards in order to persuade the more imbecile part of the public to come in and view the art exhibit. Well, the madame introduces her boys one by one and it developes [sic], as was to be expected, that there isn't the faintest hint of talent in the whole crestfallen lot of them. They can do nothnig [sic] but wear girls' clothes, poor neuters, and they look as if they needed a bath, They dance and sing, limp and pathetic, conscious of their incompetence and in1/8rmities [sic], and are accompanied by a disinterested Negro orchestra. One of them is described by the pulpy madame as the Lily Pons of the club, another as the Ethel Waters and still another hopes to be a fair imitation of Gertrude Lawrence. Two of the little mother's indistinguishable bipeds are cast as comedians and when one asks, 'Weren't you embarrassed?' the other responds, 'No, I was in Hoboken.'

They can do nothnig [sic] but wear girls' clothes, poor neuters, and they look as if they needed a bath, They dance and sing, limp and pathetic, conscious of their incompetence and in1/8rmities [sic], and are accompanied by a disinterested Negro orchestra. One of them is described by the pulpy madame as the Lily Pons of the club, another as the Ethel Waters and still another hopes to be a fair imitation of Gertrude Lawrence. Two of the little mother's indistinguishable bipeds are cast as comedians and when one asks, 'Weren't you embarrassed?' the other responds, 'No, I was in Hoboken.' The same two try later to be a little dirty, but they fall far short of almost any Broadway revue comedian you can think of. The whole thing, unless there is something cryptic about the goings on that only the initiated can understand, is a goax. Just a madame trying to make money selling 3/8owers [sic]. I am afraid her worshipped Shakespeare would call her a pander. He was a blunt man. Approximately enough, the long movie . . . has most of its scenes laid in Capri, not a stranger to evidences of nature's indecision. In one of the short 1/8lms the late Hal Skelly is the star. It is not funnier than anything the madame's loyal club fellow's [sic] have to say.\"", "source": "The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, November 27, 1934, 18"}, {"comment": "\"Performances will be given continuously every day except Sunday.
