Here is artistry of burlesque done in rare style. Maybe you do not care for this type of broad female impersonations, but these men have real artistry back of all their non-sense. They handed me a terrible comedy wallop. They close their act with a burlesque, the Russian Bat theater. Good costumes and a fine idea is worked out by the three.
