Then two of them do a travesty upon the Margie of Savoy and Brennan. Then a corking red-headed impression of a prima donna going nuts. Then the smash hit of the act, their own impression of the Duncan Sisters. Their get-up, meaning their dresses, are screams, reminding one of an ocean wave. Here is artistry of burlesque done in rare style. Maybe you do not care for this type of broad female impersonations, but these men have real artistry back of all their non-sense. They handed me a terrible comedy wallop. They close their act with a burlesque, the Russian Bat theater. Good costumes and a fine idea is worked out by the three. Here is a female impersonation act that is different, and to me it is a wow.
