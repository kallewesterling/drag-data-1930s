      "\n",
      "<p>First, you cannot use any numbers or special characters to start a variable name. So <code>1_book</code>, <code>1book</code>, or any variable that contains special characters <code>@</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>$</code>, <code>$</code>, etc, wouldn&#39;t be acceptable in Python.

      "<p>Second, you might also notice that variable syntax requires you to write the variable name first, followed by an equal sign <code>=</code>, and then the value, or data.

The thing that comes after the <code>=</code> is the data that becomes attached to the preceding variable. </p>\n",

      "<p>For the rest of this session, we&#39;re going to expand beyond the REPL to write and execute longer programs. To do this, we will begin to work with a text editor, where we write out Python scripts, and run those scripts from the terminal. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This is a big move, so let&#39;s take it slow. To reiterate, the major change is that we will be working across two spaces, the terminal and the text editor, rather than just the terminal alone. We will be writing our scripts into the text editor, and using the terminal to run those scripts. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>Your first script</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>First, let&#39;s begin with the text editor. Open your text editor of choice (such as VS Code) and create a new file with this line:</p>\n",

      "- Second, within in the text editor, you included the <code>print()</code> function  because, unlike in the REPL, things aren&#39;t automatically printed out when writing scripts.

      "<h2>A Note on Text</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Fundamentally, Python programs are just text files. You can write them in any text editor, like VS Code or Notepad on Windows.

This makes them work well with command line tools like Git. The tools you&#39;ll be learning in this workshop series---the command line, Git, markdown, grepâ€”--are all designed to work well together, and the medium through which they all work is plain text.</p>\n",
