      "\n",
      "<p>First, you cannot use any numbers or special characters to start a variable name. So <code>1_book</code>, <code>1book</code>, or any variable that contains special characters <code>@</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>$</code>, <code>$</code>, etc, wouldn&#39;t be acceptable in Python. You must start the variable with a letter and avoid using special characters.</p>\n",
      "\n",

      "<p>Second, you might also notice that variable syntax requires you to write the variable name first, followed by an equal sign <code>=</code>, and then the value, or data. You cannot start the variable statement with the data value, because python always recognizes the first thing written as the thing to be assigned. The thing that comes after the <code>=</code> is the data that becomes attached to the preceding variable. </p>\n",

The code that we write in the REPL is not saved after you exit, which means that this space is for running Python expressions and <em>not</em> for writing longer programs. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For the rest of this session, we&#39;re going to expand beyond the REPL to write and execute longer programs. To do this, we will begin to work with a text editor, where we write out Python scripts, and run those scripts from the terminal. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This is a big move, so let&#39;s take it slow. To reiterate, the major change is that we will be working across two spaces, the terminal and the text editor, rather than just the terminal alone. We will be writing our scripts into the text editor, and using the terminal to run those scripts. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>Your first script</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>First, let&#39;s begin with the text editor. Open your text editor of choice (such as VS Code) and create a new file with this line:</p>\n",

Do <em>not</em> enter the Python Interactive Mode (the REPL), which is unecessary to run python scripts. Instead, lookout for the <code>$</code> symbol that lets you know you&#39;re in the terminal. (If you find yourself in the Interactive mode (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>), then exit it with <code>control-D</code>.

      "- First, it bears repeating that you are moving between two different spaces, the text editor and the terminal. You wrote your Python script in the text editor, and used the terminal to run the script. \n",
      "- Second, within in the text editor, you included the <code>print()</code> function  because, unlike in the REPL, things aren&#39;t automatically printed out when writing scripts. When you&#39;re in the text editor, you always need to include the <code>print()</code> function so that your output will appear in the terminal. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>A Note on Text</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Fundamentally, Python programs are just text files. You can write them in any text editor, like VS Code or Notepad on Windows. When you pass the text file to Python, it runs the code in the file one line at a time. There&#39;s nothing special about <code>.py</code> files—they&#39;re just regular text files. This makes them work well with command line tools like Git. The tools you&#39;ll be learning in this workshop series---the command line, Git, markdown, grep—--are all designed to work well together, and the medium through which they all work is plain text.</p>\n",

      "<li><p>(optional) Are you already getting sick of typing <code>python hello.py</code> again and again? Try typing <code>!!</code> in the command line (the <code>$</code>).
